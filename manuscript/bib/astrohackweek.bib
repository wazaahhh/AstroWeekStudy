@article{halfaker2013,
    abstract = {{Open collaboration systems, such as Wikipedia, need to maintain a pool of volunteer contributors to remain relevant. Wikipedia was created through a tremendous number of contributions by millions of contributors. However, recent research has shown that the number of active contributors in Wikipedia has been declining steadily for years and suggests that a sharp decline in the retention of newcomers is the cause. This article presents data that show how several changes the Wikipedia community made to manage quality and consistency in the face of a massive growth in participation have ironically crippled the very growth they were designed to manage. Specifically, the restrictiveness of the encyclopedia's primary quality control mechanism and the algorithmic tools used to reject contributions are implicated as key causes of decreased newcomer retention. Furthermore, the community's formal mechanisms for norm articulation are shown to have calcified against changes‚Äîespecially changes proposed by newer editors.}},

@article{vonKrogh2012,
    abstract = {{Open source software (OSS) is a social and economic phenomenon that raises fundamental questions about
the motivations of contributors to information systems development. Some developers are unpaid volunteers
who seek to solve their own technical problems, while others create OSS as part of their employment contract.
For the past 10 years, a substantial amount of academic work has theorized about and empirically examined
developer motivations. We review this work and suggest considering motivation in terms of the values of the
social practice in which developers participate. Based on the social philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre, we
construct a theoretical framework that expands our assumptions about individual motivation to include the idea
of a long-term, value-informed quest beyond short-term rewards. This motivation‚Äìpractice framework depicts
how the social practice and its supporting institutions mediate between individual motivation and outcome.
The framework contains three theoretical conjectures that seek to explain how collectively elaborated standards
of excellence prompt developers to produce high-quality software, change institutions, and sustain OSS
development. From the framework, we derive six concrete propositions and suggest a new research agenda
on motivation in OSS.}},

    abstract = {{The "wisdom of crowds" argument emphasizes the importance of diversity in online collaborations, such as open source projects and Wikipedia. However, decades of research on diversity in offline work groups have painted an inconclusive picture. On the one hand, the broader range of insights from a diverse group can lead to improved outcomes. On the other hand, individual differences can lead to conflict and diminished performance. In this paper, we examine the effects of group diversity on the amount of work accomplished and on member withdrawal behaviors in the context of WikiProjects. We find that increased diversity in experience with Wikipedia increases group productivity and decreases member withdrawal -- up to a point. Beyond that point, group productivity remains high, but members are more likely to withdraw. Strikingly, no such diminishing returns were observed for differences in member interest, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal in a linear fashion. Our results suggest that the low visibility of individual differences in online groups may allow them to harvest more of the benefits of diversity while bearing less of the cost. We discuss how our findings can inform further research of online collaboration.}},

    abstract = {{Wikipedia's coverage of breaking news and current events dominates editor contributions and reader attention in any given month. Collaborators on breaking news articles rapidly synthesize content to produce timely information in spite of steep coordination demands. Wikipedia's coverage of breaking news events thus presents a case to test theories about how open collaborations coordinate complex, time-sensitive, and knowledge-intensive work in the absence of central authority, stable membership, clear roles, or reliable information. Using the revision history from Wikipedia articles about over 3,000 breaking news events, we investigate the structure of interactions between editors and articles. Because breaking article collaborations unfold more rapidly and involve more editors than most Wikipedia articles, they potentially regenerate prior forms of organizing. We analyze whether the structures of breaking and nonbreaking article networks are (a) similarly structured over time, (b) exhibit features of organizational regeneration, and (c) have similar collaboration dynamics over time. Breaking and nonbreaking article exhibit similarities in their structural characteristics over the long run, and there is less evidence of organizational regeneration on breaking articles than nonbreaking articles. However, breaking articles emerge into well-connected collaborations more rapidly than nonbreaking articles, suggesting early contributors play a crucial role in supporting these high-tempo collaborations.}},

The online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which presently comprises 7.2 million articles created by 7.04 million distinct editors, provides a consummate example. We examined all 50 million edits made tothe 1.5 million English-language Wikipedia articles and found that the high-quality articles are distinguished by a marked increase in number of edits, number of editors, and intensity of cooperative behavior, as compared to other articles of similar visibility and age. This is significant because in other domains, fruitful cooperation has proven to be difficult to sustain as the size of the collaboration increases. Furthermore, in spite of the vagaries of human behavior, we show that Wikipedia articles accrete edits according to a simple stochastic mechanism in which edits beget edits. Topics of high interest or relevance are thus naturally brought to the forefront of quality.}},

Queueing theory is believed to provide a generic answer to account for the often observed power-law distributions of waiting times before a task is fulfilled. However, the general validity of the power law and the nature of other regimes remain unsettled. Using anonymized data collected by Google at the World Wide Web level, we identify the existence of several additional regimes characterizing the time required for a population of Internet users to execute a given task after receiving a message. Depending on the under- or over-utilization of time by the population of users and the strength of their response to perturbations, the pure power law is found to be coextensive with an exponential regime (tasks are performed without too much delay) and with a crossover to an asymptotic plateau (some tasks are never performed).}},

We show that, in this model, the fraction of earthquakes in the population that are aftershocks is equal to the fraction of aftershocks that are indirectly triggered and is given by the average number of triggered events per earthquake. Previous observations that a significant fraction of earthquakes are triggered earthquakes therefore imply that most aftershocks are indirectly triggered by the mainshock.}},

We find clear distinguishing signatures classifying two types of sales peaks. Exogenous peaks occur abruptly and are followed by a power law relaxation, while endogenous peaks occur after a progressively accelerating power law growth followed by an approximately symmetrical power law relaxation which is slower than for exogenous peaks. These results are rationalized quantitatively by a simple model of epidemic propagation of interactions with long memory within a network of acquaintances. The observed relaxation of sales implies that the sales dynamics is dominated by cascades rather than by the direct effects of news or advertisements, indicating that the social network is close to critical.}},

We find that most activity can be described accurately as a Poisson process. However, we also find hundreds of thousands of examples in which a burst of activity is followed by an ubiquitous power-law relaxation governing the timing of views. We find that these relaxation exponents cluster into three distinct classes and allow for the classification of collective human dynamics. This is consistent with an epidemic model on a social network containing two ingredients: a power-law distribution of waiting times between cause and action and an epidemic cascade of actions becoming the cause of future actions. This model is a conceptual extension of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to social systems [Ruelle, D (2004) Phys Today 57:48‚Äö√Ñ√¨53] and [Roehner BM, et al., (2004) Int J Mod Phys C 15:809‚Äö√Ñ√¨834], and provides a unique framework for the investigation of timing in complex systems.}},

Laeven Dept. of Econometrics and Operations Research PO Box 90153 5000 LE Tilburg, The Netherlands E-Mail: R.J.A.Laeven@uvt.nl Adverse shocks to stock markets propagate across the world, with a jump in one region of the world seemingly causing an increase in the likelihood of a different jump in another region of the world. To capture this effect mathematically, we introduce a model for asset return dynamics with a drift component, a volatility component and mutually exciting jumps known as Hawkes processes. In the model, a jump in one region of the world or one segment of the market increases the intensity of jumps occurring both in the same region (self-excitation) as well as in other regions (cross-excitation). The model generates the type of jump clustering that is observed empirically. Jump intensities then mean-revert until the next jump. We develop and implement an estimation procedure for this model. Our estimates provide evidence for self-excitation both in the US market as well as in other world markets. Furthermore, we find that US jumps tend to get reflected quickly in most other markets, while statistical evidence for the reverse transmission is much less pronounced. Implications of the model for measuring market stress, risk management and optimal portfolio choise are also investigated.}},

These systems can be modelled by so-called self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes. It is generally assumed that all events have similar triggering abilities. However, some systems exhibit heterogeneity and clusters with possibly different intra- and inter-triggering, which can be accounted for by generalization into the  ‚Äù multivariate‚Äù self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes. We develop the general formalism of the multivariate moment generating function for the cumulative number of first-generation and of all generation events triggered by a given mother event (the  ‚Äù shock‚Äù) as a function of the current time t. This corresponds to studying the response function of the process. A variety of different systems have been analyzed. In particular, for systems in which triggering between events of different types proceeds through a one-dimension directed or symmetric chain of influence in type space, we report a novel hierarchy of intermediate asymptotic power law decays ‚àº 1/t

point processes, that can model natural and social systems, including
earthquakes, epileptic seizures and the dynamics of neuron assemblies, bursts

bank network fragility and cascading of failures, national sovereign default
contagion, and so on. We present the general theory of multivariate generating
functions to derive the number of events over all generations of various types
that are triggered by a mother event of a given type. We obtain the stability
domains of various systems, as a function of the topological structure of the
mutual excitations across different event types. We find that mutual triggering
tends to provide a significant extension of the stability (or subcritical)
domain compared with the case where event types are decoupled, that is, when an
event of a given type can only trigger events of the same type.}},

    abstract = {{Point processes and random measures find wide applicability in
telecommunications, earthquakes, image analysis, spatial point patterns and
stereology, to name but a few areas. The authors have made a major reshaping
of their work in their first edition of 1988 and now present \_An Introduction
to the Theory of Point Processes\_ in two volumes with subtitles \_Volume I:
Elementary Theory and Methods\_ and \_Volume II: General Theory and Structure.\_

\_Volume I\_ contains the introductory chapters from the first edition together
with an account of basic models, second order theory, and an informal account
of prediction, with the aim of making the material accessible to readers
primarily interested in models and applications. It also has three appendices
that review the mathematical background needed mainly in Volume II.

\_Volume II\_ sets out the basic theory of random measures and point processes
in a unified setting and continues with the more theoretical topics of the
first edition: limit theorems, ergodic theory, Palm theory, and evolutionary
behaviour via martingales and conditional intensity. The very substantial new
material in this second volume includes expanded discussions of marked point
processes, convergence to equilibrium, and the structure of spatial point
processes.}},

We estimate this previously unmeasured type of household sector innovation to be quite large: 6.1\% of UK consumers‚Äînearly 2.9 million individuals‚Äîhave engaged in consumer product innovation during the prior three years. In aggregate, consumers' annual product development expenditures are more than 1.4 times larger than the annual consumer product R\&D expenditures of all firms in the United Kingdom combined. Consumers engage in many small projects that seem complementary to the innovation efforts of incumbent producers. Consumer innovators very seldom protect their innovations via intellectual property, and 17\% diffuse to others. These results imply that, at the country level, productivity studies yield inflated effect sizes for producer innovation in consumer goods. They also imply that existing companies should reconfigure their product development systems to find and build on prototypes developed by consumers.}},
